## 3. Color Logic ‚Äì The "Secret Sauce"

### üîÅ Shared Color Language (Cross-Instrument)

- Universal HSV-based chromatic color map:
  - C = Red, C#/Db = Red-Orange, ..., B = Purple.
  - Consistent across views and users.
- Note played ‚ûú lights up in same color on all devices, all views.
- Grid view updates live (keyboard, guitar, etc.) on every device in the room.

### üí° Lighting Priority

- **Active notes**: bright, fully saturated.
- **AI-suggested**: pulsing, desaturated.
- **Faded history**: dimmed hue version.

### üéØ Intuitive Instrument Feedback

- On-screen instruments light up in real time.
- No physical hardware needed for MVP.
- Mobile screen becomes the instrument‚Äôs mirror ‚Äî notes appear where they'd be played.

### üß† AI Conductor

- Suggests next notes based on real-time play.
- Guides solos, fills, harmonies.
- Works across mobile + desktop ‚ûú visible on every user‚Äôs active view.
